# Partial-Differential-Equations

Set of Jupyter notebooks with numerical solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). In each of the Jupyter Notebooks there is an implementation of a specific algorithm to solve a given PDE. Check, for instance, the [Finite Differences Method]() or the [Pseudospectral Method]().
