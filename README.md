# Partial-Differential-Equations

Set of Jupyter notebooks with numerical solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). In each of the Jupyter Notebooks there is an implementation of a specific algorithm to solve a given PDE. Check, for instance, the [Finite Differences Method](https://github.com/Physics-Simulations/Partial-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Finite_differences.ipynb) or the [Pseudospectral Method](https://github.com/Physics-Simulations/Partial-Differential-Equations/blob/master/Pseudospectral.ipynb).
